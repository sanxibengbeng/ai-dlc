# User Management Domain Model Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to design the Domain Model for the User Management & Authentication Service based on the user stories US-SA-1 and US-SM-1.

## Analysis Summary
- **User Stories**: US-SA-1 (Solution Architect Account Creation) and US-SM-1 (Sales Manager Account Creation)
- **Key Requirements**: Account registration, email verification, authentication, profile management, role management
- **Shared Components**: User Component Model from shared_model.md

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze User Stories and Extract Domain Requirements
- [x] Review US-SA-1 and US-SM-1 acceptance criteria
- [x] Identify core domain concepts and business rules
- [x] Map requirements to domain behaviors and attributes
- [x] Document business invariants and validation rules

### Step 2: Design Core Domain Entities
- [x] Copy User Component Model from shared_model.md as the base entity
- [x] Design UserAccount entity for account management
- [x] Design EmailVerification entity for email verification process
- [x] Design AuthenticationSession entity for session management
- [x] Define entity relationships and dependencies

[Question] Should the domain model include password management entities (like PasswordHash, PasswordResetToken) or should these be considered implementation details?
[Answer] no

[Question] Do you want separate entities for different user roles (SolutionArchitect, SalesManager) or should role be handled as an attribute/enum in the User entity?
[Answer] handled as an attribute/enum in the User entity

### Step 3: Define Domain Services and Behaviors
- [x] Design UserRegistrationService for account creation workflow
- [x] Design EmailVerificationService for email verification process
- [x] Design AuthenticationService for login/logout operations
- [x] Design UserProfileService for profile management
- [x] Define service interfaces and contracts

### Step 4: Define Domain Events
- [x] Design UserRegistered event
- [x] Design EmailVerificationRequested event
- [x] Design EmailVerified event
- [x] Design UserLoggedIn event
- [x] Design UserLoggedOut event
- [x] Design UserProfileUpdated event

[Question] Should we include domain events for failed authentication attempts or account lockout scenarios?
[Answer] no

### Step 5: Define Value Objects
- [x] Design Email value object with validation
- [x] Design EmployeeId value object
- [x] Design UserRole value object/enum
- [x] Design AccountStatus value object/enum
- [x] Define validation rules for each value object

### Step 6: Define Aggregates and Aggregate Roots
- [x] Identify User as the primary aggregate root
- [x] Define aggregate boundaries and consistency rules
- [x] Ensure proper encapsulation of business logic
- [x] Define aggregate invariants

### Step 7: Define Repository Interfaces
- [x] Design UserRepository interface
- [x] Design EmailVerificationRepository interface
- [x] Design AuthenticationSessionRepository interface
- [x] Define query methods and specifications

### Step 8: Document Domain Model Interactions
- [x] Document user registration workflow
- [x] Document email verification workflow
- [x] Document authentication workflow
- [x] Document profile update workflow
- [x] Create sequence diagrams for key interactions

### Step 9: Validate Domain Model Against User Stories
- [x] Verify US-SA-1 acceptance criteria can be fulfilled
- [x] Verify US-SM-1 acceptance criteria can be fulfilled
- [x] Ensure all business rules are properly modeled
- [x] Check for missing domain concepts

### Step 10: Finalize and Review Domain Model
- [x] Review entity relationships and dependencies
- [x] Validate business logic encapsulation
- [x] Ensure proper separation of concerns
- [x] Create final domain model documentation

## Plan Completion Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All steps have been successfully executed. The User Management Domain Model has been designed and documented in `/aidlc-docs/construction/user_management_domain_model.md`.

## Questions for Clarification

[Question] Should the domain model include audit trail entities to track changes to user accounts and profiles?
[Answer] no

[Question] Do you want to model user preferences or settings as part of the domain model, or should these be handled separately?
[Answer] no

[Question] Should we include domain logic for account deactivation/reactivation workflows in this model?
[Answer] no

## Notes
- The domain model will focus on the core business logic for user management and authentication
- Implementation details like database schemas, API endpoints, and UI components are out of scope
- The model will strictly follow Domain-Driven Design principles
- All shared components will be copied exactly as defined in shared_model.md
