# User Story Review and Refinement

This document provides a comprehensive review of all user stories created for the Solution Architect Matching System, ensuring they follow INVEST principles, have clear acceptance criteria, and align with business objectives.

## INVEST Principles Review

All user stories have been reviewed against the INVEST principles:

- **Independent**: Stories should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories
- **Negotiable**: Stories should leave room for discussion
- **Valuable**: Stories should deliver value to stakeholders
- **Estimable**: Teams should be able to estimate the effort required
- **Small**: Stories should be small enough to plan and prioritize
- **Testable**: Stories should have clear acceptance criteria
