- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All access attempts are logged
- Unauthorized access attempts trigger alerts
- Regular security audits verify access control effectiveness
- Authentication mechanisms follow industry best practices

### NFR-S-2: Data Protection
**Requirement:** The system shall protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Audit logs cannot be modified by regular users
- Audit data can be exported for compliance reporting
- Regular audit log reviews scheduled
- Compliance reports available for authorized personnel

## Scalability Requirements

### NFR-SC-1: User Scalability
**Requirement:** The system shall accommodate growth in the user base without significant performance degradation.
- Support for up to 1,000 registered users
- Support for up to 200 concurrent users during peak periods
- Linear performance scaling with increased user load
- No code changes required to support user growth

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Performance testing with simulated user loads
- Resource utilization monitored during peak usage
- Scalability metrics documented and reviewed
- Growth projections updated quarterly

### NFR-SC-2: Data Scalability
**Requirement:** The system shall handle increasing data volumes efficiently.
- Support for up to 10,000 opportunities per year
- Support for up to 1,000 Solution Architects
- Efficient storage and retrieval of historical data
- Archive strategy for older data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database performance maintained as data volume increases
- Query optimization for large data sets
- Data archiving processes tested and verified
- Storage requirements projected and planned

### NFR-SC-3: Functional Scalability
**Requirement:** The system shall allow for the addition of new features and capabilities with minimal disruption.
- Modular architecture supporting feature extensions
- API-first design for integration capabilities
- Configuration-driven behavior where possible
- Clear extension points documented

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New features can be added without major refactoring
- Integration points well-documented and tested
- Configuration changes don't require system restarts
- Technical documentation includes extension guidelines

## Usability Requirements

### NFR-U-1: User Interface
**Requirement:** The system shall provide an intuitive and efficient user interface.
- Consistent design patterns across all screens
- Responsive design supporting desktop and tablet devices
