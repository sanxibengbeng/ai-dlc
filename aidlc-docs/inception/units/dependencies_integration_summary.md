# Dependencies and Integration Summary

## Service Dependencies Overview

### 1. User Management & Authentication Service
**Dependencies:** None (foundational service)
**Dependents:** All other services (for authentication)
**Integration Points:**
- Provides authentication tokens to all services
- Shares user basic profile data

### 2. System Administration Service  
**Dependencies:** User Management & Authentication Service
**Dependents:** All services (for configuration and skills catalog)
**Integration Points:**
- Provides skills catalog to SA Profile & Skills Service and Opportunity Management Service
- Provides algorithm configuration to Matching Engine Service
- Receives data from all services for reporting

### 3. Solution Architect Profile & Skills Service
**Dependencies:** 
- User Management & Authentication Service (authentication)
- System Administration Service (skills catalog)
**Dependents:** 
- Matching Engine Service (profile and availability data)
- Selection & Assignment Service (availability updates)
**Integration Points:**
- Provides SA profiles and availability to Matching Engine
- Receives availability updates from Selection & Assignment Service

### 4. Opportunity Management Service
**Dependencies:**
- User Management & Authentication Service (authentication)
- System Administration Service (skills catalog)
**Dependents:**
- Matching Engine Service (opportunity details)
- Selection & Assignment Service (status updates)
**Integration Points:**
- Triggers matching process when opportunities are submitted
- Receives status updates when SAs are selected

### 5. Matching Engine Service
**Dependencies:**
- Solution Architect Profile & Skills Service (SA data)
- Opportunity Management Service (opportunity data)
- System Administration Service (algorithm configuration)
**Dependents:**
- Selection & Assignment Service (match results)
**Integration Points:**
- Processes matching requests from Opportunity Management
- Provides match results to Selection & Assignment Service
- Sends match notifications

### 6. Selection & Assignment Service
**Dependencies:**
- Matching Engine Service (match results)
- Solution Architect Profile & Skills Service (detailed profiles)
- Opportunity Management Service (opportunity details)
- User Management & Authentication Service (authentication)
**Dependents:** None (end of workflow)
**Integration Points:**
- Updates SA availability in Profile & Skills Service
- Updates opportunity status in Opportunity Management Service
- Sends assignment notifications

## Shared Data Models

### Core Entities
- **User**: Basic user information (id, name, email, role)
- **Solution Architect Profile**: Complete SA profile with skills and availability
- **Opportunity**: Complete opportunity details with requirements
- **Skills Catalog**: Standardized skills taxonomy
- **Match Results**: Matching scores and recommendations
- **Assignments**: SA-Opportunity assignments

### Integration Data
- **Authentication Tokens**: JWT tokens for service-to-service communication
- **Configuration Parameters**: Algorithm weights and system settings
- **Notification Templates**: Email templates and preferences
- **Audit Logs**: System activity and change tracking

## API Integration Patterns

### Synchronous APIs
- Authentication and authorization (User Management)
- Skills catalog queries (System Administration)
- Profile and availability queries (SA Profile & Skills)
- Opportunity details queries (Opportunity Management)
- Match results queries (Matching Engine)

### Asynchronous Events
- Opportunity submission triggers matching
- Match completion triggers notification
- Selection completion triggers status updates
- Availability changes trigger re-matching (if needed)

## Parallel Development Feasibility

### Independent Development Tracks
1. **Track 1**: User Management & Authentication Service (foundational)
2. **Track 2**: System Administration Service (configuration and catalog)
3. **Track 3**: Solution Architect Profile & Skills Service
4. **Track 4**: Opportunity Management Service  
5. **Track 5**: Matching Engine Service
6. **Track 6**: Selection & Assignment Service

### Development Sequence Recommendations
1. **Phase 1**: User Management & Authentication + System Administration (foundational services)
2. **Phase 2**: SA Profile & Skills + Opportunity Management (can be parallel)
3. **Phase 3**: Matching Engine + Selection & Assignment (can be parallel after Phase 2)

### Mock/Stub Requirements
- Each service should provide mock implementations for dependencies during development
- API contracts must be defined early for parallel development
- Integration testing environment needed for end-to-end validation

## Notes
- All services designed as independent microservices
- Clear API boundaries enable parallel development
- Shared data models documented for consistency
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Each service has its own database (database per service pattern)

## Component Model Development Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze core entities from the Shared Data Models section
- [x] 2. Review comprehensive user stories to understand entity attributes and relationships
- [x] 3. Define the User component model with all attributes
- [x] 4. Define the Solution Architect Profile component model with all attributes
- [x] 5. Define the Opportunity component model with all attributes
- [x] 6. Define the Skills Catalog component model with all attributes
- [x] 7. Define the Match Results component model with all attributes
- [x] 8. Define the Assignments component model with all attributes
- [x] 9. Document relationships between components
- [x] 10. Review and validate the component models against user stories
- [x] 11. Finalize the shared_model.md document

[Question] Should the component models include technical implementation details like data types and constraints, or should they be more conceptual at this stage?
[Answer] Include data types.

[Question] Are there any specific notation or diagramming standards you'd like me to follow for the component models?
[Answer] No diagram needed.

[Question] Should I include sample data or examples for each component model?
[Answer] Yes
