# Units of Work Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach to group the comprehensive user stories into cohesive units of work that can be implemented in parallel. Each unit represents a bounded context aligned with specific business capabilities and can be developed by a single team.

## Analysis Summary
Based on the comprehensive user stories, I've identified the following bounded contexts (revised based on answers):

1. **User Management & Authentication Service** - Account creation, authentication, profile management
2. **Solution Architect Profile & Skills Service** - Skills registration, availability management
3. **Opportunity Management Service** - Opportunity creation, modification, tracking by Sales Managers
4. **Matching Engine Service** - Core matching algorithm, recommendation system, and matching notifications
5. **Selection & Assignment Service** - Selection workflow and assignment notifications
6. **System Administration Service** - User management, configuration, reporting

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] **Step 1**: Analyze user stories and identify bounded contexts
  - Review all user stories from comprehensive_user_stories.md
  - Identify natural groupings based on business capabilities
  - Ensure each unit has high cohesion and loose coupling with others

- [x] **Step 2**: Define unit boundaries and dependencies
  - Map dependencies between units
  - Identify shared data models and integration points
  - Ensure units can be developed in parallel with minimal blocking dependencies

### Phase 2: Unit Definition
- [x] **Step 3**: Create User Management & Authentication unit
  - Group account creation and authentication stories
  - Include basic profile management capabilities
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 4**: Create Solution Architect Profile & Skills Management unit
  - Group all SA skills registration stories (technical, soft, industry, language, geographic)
  - Include availability management stories
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 5**: Create Opportunity Management unit
  - Group all Sales Manager opportunity-related stories
  - Include opportunity creation, modification, tracking, and cancellation
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 6**: Create Matching Engine unit
  - Group all matching algorithm stories
  - Include skills-based matching, availability filtering, scoring
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 7**: Create Selection & Assignment Process unit
  - Group selection process stories
  - Include viewing recommendations, making selections, notifications
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 8**: Create System Administration unit
  - Group all administrative stories
  - Include user management, configuration, reporting
  - Define acceptance criteria for each story

- [x] **Step 9**: ~~Create Notification & Communication unit~~ (Merged into other units as per requirements)
  - Notifications integrated into Matching Engine Service and Selection & Assignment Service
  - Email notifications handled within respective business contexts

### Phase 3: Review and Validation
- [x] **Step 10**: Review unit definitions for completeness
  - Ensure all user stories are assigned to appropriate units
  - Verify no stories are duplicated or missed
  - Validate unit boundaries and cohesion

- [x] **Step 11**: Validate dependencies and integration points
  - Document inter-unit dependencies
  - Identify shared data models and APIs
  - Ensure parallel development feasibility

## Questions for Clarification

[Question] Should the Notification & Communication unit be merged with other units, or do you prefer it as a separate cross-cutting concern?
[Answer] Merge it as part of other matching units.

[Question] Are there any specific technical constraints or architectural patterns you want me to consider when defining unit boundaries (e.g., microservices, modular monolith)?
[Answer] Microservices

[Question] Do you want me to include any specific non-functional requirements or quality attributes in each unit's documentation?
[Answer] No

[Question] Should I prioritize the units in any particular order for development, or should they all be treated as equal priority for parallel development?
[Answer] All equal

[Question] Are there any existing system integrations or external dependencies that should influence the unit boundaries?
[Answer] No

## Next Steps
Once you review and approve this plan, I will execute each step systematically, marking completed steps with checkboxes. Each unit will be documented in a separate markdown file with:
- Unit overview and scope
- Grouped user stories with acceptance criteria
- Key responsibilities and capabilities
- Integration points with other units
